Beagle 2 (2003) - European Space Agency (ESA) but relevant to mention
Objective: Search for life on Mars.
Outcome: Failure. Lost upon landing.
Reason for Failure: It's believed that one of the solar panels failed to deploy, blocking the communications antenna.

Orion 3 (1995)
Objective: Communication satellite launch.
Outcome: Failure. Did not reach intended orbit.
Reason for Failure: The third stage of the rocket failed to ignite

Mariner 1 (1962)
Objective: Venus flyby.
Outcome: Failure. Destroyed 293 seconds after launch.
Reason for Failure: Guidance system malfunction due to a coding error.

Mars Polar Lander (1999)
Objective: Study Martian weather at the south pole.
Outcome: Failure. Lost during descent to Mars.
Reason for Failure: Likely a premature engine shutdown, causing a hard landing.

Deep Space 2 (1999)
Objective: Demonstrate new landing technology on Mars.
Outcome: Failure. Lost upon reaching Mars.
Reason for Failure: Unknown, though it's speculated the probes may have been destroyed upon impact.

Genesis (2001)
Objective: Collect samples of solar wind.
Outcome: Crash-landed upon return to Earth.
Reason for Failure: The parachute did not deploy due to a design flaw in G-switch sensors.

Phobos-Grunt (2011) - Russian mission but worth mentioning due to its importance
Objective: Return samples from Marsâ€™ moon Phobos.
Outcome: Failure. Did not leave Earth's orbit to begin its journey to Mars.
Reason for Failure: Problems with the onboard computer system and propulsion module.

Mars Observer (1992)
Objective: Study Mars' surface, atmosphere, and climate.
Outcome: Failure. Lost contact three days before Mars orbit insertion.
Reason for Failure: Probable fuel tank rupture.

TESS (in its original mission design) (2018)
Objective: Search for exoplanets using a wide-field telescope.
Outcome: Technical malfunction. The satellite faced a critical issue with its cameras.
Reason for Failure: A thermal issue affected the quality of images, but NASA was able to reconfigure and continue the mission, proving its adaptability.

CONTOUR (Comet Nucleus Tour) (2002)
Objective: Study two comets closely.
Outcome: Failure. Lost after a rocket burn intended to send it out of Earth's orbit.
Reason for Failure: Suspected structural failure during rocket burn.

Nimbus B1 (1968)
Objective: Earth observation for meteorological research.
Outcome: Failure. Did not reach the intended orbit.
Reason for Failure: Malfunction during the launch sequence.

ADEOS I (Advanced Earth Observing Satellite) (1996) - A collaboration involving NASA
Objective: Earth observation to study the environment.
Outcome: Failure. Lost contact less than a year after launch.
Reason for Failure: Solar panel failure.

Mars 96 (1996) - Russian space mission with international contributions
Objective: Study Mars from orbit and the surface.
Outcome: Failure. Crashed in the South Pacific shortly after launch.
Reason for Failure: Fourth stage rocket malfunction.

Kosmos 482 (1972) - Soviet Venus mission
Objective: Study Venus.
Outcome: Failure. Stuck in Earth's orbit and eventually re-entered the atmosphere.
Reason for Failure: Launch vehicle failure.

Nozomi (Planet-B) (1998) - Japanese Mars mission
Objective: Study the Martian atmosphere and its interaction with the solar wind.
Outcome: Failure. Did not achieve Mars orbit.
Reason for Failure: Electrical failures and fuel leaks after a solar flare damaged onboard systems.

ASTRO-E (2000) - Japanese X-ray satellite
Objective: Observe X-rays from high-energy astronomical phenomena.
Outcome: Failure. Did not reach orbit.
Reason for Failure: Launch vehicle malfunction.

Observer (1986)
Objective: Earth observation for various scientific purposes.
Outcome: Failure. Launch failure led to the destruction of the satellite.
Reason for Failure: Malfunction in the Titan rocket's second stage.

Outcome: Tragedy. A cabin fire during a launch rehearsal killed all three astronauts.
Reason for Failure: Electrical fault in a high-oxygen environment, design flaws in the hatch mechanism.
Beagle 2 (2003) - British landing spacecraft, part of ESA's Mars Express mission
Objective: Study the atmosphere, climate, and geology of Mars.
Outcome: Failure. It did land on Mars but failed to fully deploy and communicate.
Reason for Failure: Likely a solar panel deployment failure.

Fobos 1 (1988) - Soviet mission
Objective: Study Mars' moon Phobos.
Outcome: Failure. Lost contact en route to Mars.
Reason for Failure: A command error, which turned the spacecraft's antennas away from Earth, leading to a loss of communication.

Challenger STS-51-L (1986)
Objective: Deploy satellites, conduct spacewalks, and carry out various experiments.
Outcome: Tragedy. The Space Shuttle Challenger broke apart 73 seconds into its flight, leading to the deaths of seven astronauts.
Reason for Failure: O-ring failure in the right solid rocket booster, causing structural failure.

Gloria (2011) - Spanish Earth observation satellite
Objective: Monitor land and coastal areas.
Outcome: Failure. Did not reach the intended orbit.
Reason for Failure: Launch vehicle anomaly.
